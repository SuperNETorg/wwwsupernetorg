                        SuperNET is a collaborative community of participating cryptocurrency coins
                        and their development teams, alongside innovative coders, networking experts, 
                        social-media and commercial development specialists and third-party service-providers,
                        seeking to create a united platform of technologies focusing on the establishment of
                        decentralised delivery of previously centralised online services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SuperNET itself is not a digital currency, it is the collective identity by which
                        the members of the community work together to promote as a recognisable
                        brand of technical innovation and delivery.

                    </p>
                        It also exists as a community-owned asset which holds investments in and distributes dividend
                        from revenues created by its numerous project arms. This asset can be found on the NXT Decentralised Asset Exchange

                        The criteria for cryptocurrencies to become part of the SuperNET CORE is based on their technical innovation
                        and potential for use within the SuperNET platform, as well as those which have strong development teams,
                        commercial utility and/or large and supportive communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SuperNET's purpose and function is to shape a cutting-edge service range whilst also creating bleeding-edge innovation.

                        Through utilising multiple coin networks and technologies which are able to rapidly evolve and change
                        to accommodate end-user needs alongside the regular introduction of entirely new methodologies and techniques,
                        we are able to adapt and focus on the changing nature of end-user expectations whilst providing fully scalable
                        architecture with which to service the multiple facets of this ever-growing industry, under the ethos of Unity.
